# Dynamic cyber risk estimation with Competitive Quantile Autoregression

The visualisation of the predictions of the cyber hacking breaches' sizes is available [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/alan-turing-institute/dynamic_cyber_risk/blob/main/notebooks/breach_size_HACK.nb.html), and of the predictions of cyber hacking breaches' inter-arrival times is available [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/alan-turing-institute/dynamic_cyber_risk/blob/main/notebooks/breach_time_HACK.nb.html). You can also reproduce the results using [Binder](https://mybinder.org). Click on [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/alan-turing-institute/dynamic_cyber_risk/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio). You will see the RStudio window. In the RStudio, you can run the notebooks located in the folder `notebooks` that reproduce the paper's results. The main functions of the implementation are located in the folder `dynamic_risk`.


## Installation

The easiest way to run the project is to use Binder (see above). If you want to run the project locally you need to download [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com).
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/dynamic_cyber_risk.git dynamic_cyber_risk
```
Open Rstudio and run `install.R` to install the required packages. After that, you should be able to run the notebooks to reproduce the paper's results.
