It discovered the intrusion mid-December 2006. Transaction data from 2003 as well as mid-May through December 2006 may have been accessed. According to its Web site, TJX is the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide.Note on our total: included in this breach are 45,700,000 credit and debit card account numbers; 455,000 merchandise return records containing customer names and driver's license numbers; recovery of about 200,000 stolen credit card account numbers; records then 1indicated an additional 48 million people have been affected. Totals were estimated at 94 million but now seem to have affected over 100 million accounts.UPDATE  (2/22/2007):TJX said that while it first thought the intrusion took place from May 2006 to January 2007, it now thinks its computer system was also hacked in July 2005 and on various subsequent dates that year.UPDATE (3/21/2007): Information stolen from TJX's systems was being used fraudulently in November 2006 in an $8 million gift card scheme, one month before TJX officials said they learned of the breach, according to Florida law enforcement officials. UPDATE  (3/29/2007): The company reported in its SEC filing that 45.7 million credit and debit card numbers were hacked, along with 455,000 merchandise return records containing customers' driver's license numbers, Military ID numbers or Social Security numbers. UPDATE (4/22/2007): Initially, TJX said the break-in started seven months before it was discovered. Then, on Feb. 18, the company noted the perpetrators had access to data for 17 months, and apparently began in July 2005. UPDATE (04/26/2007): Three states' banking associations (MA, CT, and ME) filed a class action lawsuit against TJX to recover the costs of damages totaling tens of millions of dollars incurred for replacing customers' debit and credit cards. UPDATE (05/04/2007): An article in the WSJ notes that because TJX had an outdated wireless security encryption system, had failed to install firewalls and data encryption on computers using the wireless network, and had not properly install another layer of security software it had bought, thieves were able to access data streaming between hand-held price-checking devices, cash registers and the store's computers. 21 U.S. and Canadian lawsuits seek damages from the retailer for reissuing compromised cards. UPDATE (07/10/2007): U.S. Secret Service agents found TJX customers' credit card numbers in the hands of Eastern European cyber thieves who created high-quality counterfeit credit cards. Victims are from the U.S., Europe, Asia and Canada, among other places, Several Cuban nationals in Florida were arrested with more than 200,000 credit card account numbers. UPDATE (08/31/2007): The U.S. Secret Service Agency earlier this week said it has arrested and indicted four members of an organized fraud ring in South Florida, charging each of them with aggravated identity theft, counterfeit credit-card trafficking, and conspiracy. UPDATE (09/21/2007): A ring leader in the TJX Cos.-linked credit card fraud, was sentenced to five years in prison and has been ordered to pay nearly $600,000 in restitution for damages resulting from stolen financial information. UPDATE (09/25/2007): TJX announced the terms of a settlement for customers affected by the data breach -- with strings attached. Credit monitoring will be offered to about 455,000 of the 46 million affected. TJX will reimburse customers who had to replace driver's licenses as a result of the breach if they submit documentation for the time and money spent on replacing licenses. The company will give a $30 store voucher to those customers who submit documentation about their lost time and money. And TJX will hold a special 3-day sale with a 15% discount sometime in 2008. The settlement still needs to be approved by the court. UPDATE (10/23/2007): Court filings in a case brought by banks against TJX say the number of accounts affected by the thefts topped 94 million. UPDATE (10/23/2007): The total number of records increased from 167 million to 215 million. Recent court filings in a case brought by banks against TJX say the number of accounts affected by the thefts topped 94 million, up considerably from 45,7 million credit and debit card account numbers initially thought to be compromised. Breach costs have been estimated at $216 million. UPDATE (11/30/2007): Fifth Third Bancorp, the Ohio bank that was fined $880,000 by Visa for its role in the customer data security breach at TJX Cos., the largest ever, also paid fines and compensation totaling $1.4 million following the loss of data from BJ's Wholesale Club Inc. UPDATE (12/05/2007): An InternetNews.com article estimates TJX expenses at $500 million to $1 billion. In a settlement with VISA USA, TJX will pay a maximum of $40.9 million to fund an alternative recovery payments program for customers affected by the breach. At least 19 lawsuits have been filed, and there are investigations underway by the Federal Trade Commission and 37 state Attorneys General. UPDATE (12/18/2007): TJX has settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount.Although both sides said the settlement total would remain confidential, TJX said the costs were covered by a $107 million reserve that it set aside against its second-quarter earnings.TJX also has said that $107 million would cover the costs of another breach agreement: a Nov. 30 deal with Visa Inc. to help pay a maximum $40.9 million to help the network's card-issuing banks recover expenses to replace customers' Visa cards. UPDATE (2/10/2008): Notices are going out to millions of customers who may have had credit card information compromised in a data breach. The notices contain information about eligibility for compensation such as vouchers and credit monitoring to be provided under a proposed settlement. UPDATE (4/2/2008): TJX Cos. reached a settlement with MasterCard Inc. in which it will pay up to $24 million to banks and other institutions to cover fraud losses stemming from a massive data breach disclosed last year. They also struck a similar deal with rival card network Visa in which it agreed to pay up to $40.9 million. As in that deal, TJX said the costs of its MasterCard settlement are included in the $256 million the company has set aside to pay for computer work and other costs associated with the breach. UPDATE (5/14/2008): The TJX Companies, Inc. today announced that it completed its previously announced settlement with MasterCard International Incorporated and its issuers. Financial institutions representing 99.5% of eligible MasterCard accounts worldwide claimed to have been affected by the unauthorized computer intrusion(s) at TJX accepted the alternative recovery offer under TJX's previously announced Settlement Agreement with MasterCard. UPDATE (8/5/2008): Eleven perpetrators allegedly involved in the hacking of nine major U.S. retailers have been charged with numerous crimes, including conspiracy, computer intrusion, fraud and identity theft. This is the largest hacking and identity theft case ever prosecuted by the U.S. Department of Justice. An indictment was returned on Aug. 5, 2008. Conspirators obtained the credit and debit card numbers by wardriving and hacking into the wireless computer networks of major retailers -- including TJX Companies, BJ's Wholesale Club, OfficeMax, Boston Market, Barnes & Noble, Sports Authority, Forever 21 and DSW. The indictments are the result of a three-year undercover investigation conducted out of the San Diego Field Office of the U.S. Secret Service. UPDATE (8/30/2008): TrustCo BankCorp NY sued TJX in August 2008 to recoup costs it incurred from reissuing an estimated 4,000 customer MasterCard debit cards after hackers accessed the TJX computer network. The bank stated its cost for the breach was up to $20 per affected account, explaining that it suffered losses from administrative expenses and lost interest and transaction fees. Later in the month, TJX in turn claimed that Trustco failed to implement policies or procedures that would have enabled the bank to avoid canceling and replacing customer debit cards. UPDATE (9/22/2008):One of the 11 people arrested last month in connection with the massive data theft at T JX Companies Inc., BJ Wholesale Clubs Inc. and several other retailers pleaded guilty yesterday to four felony counts, including wire and credit card fraud and aggravated identity theft. Many of the Internet attacks that he facilitated were SQL injection attacks, according to court documents. The stolen data was sold to cyber criminals in Eastern Europe and the U.S. or used to make fraudulent credit and debit cards. UPDATE (6/26/2009): TJX has agreed to pay $9.75 million to 41 states and to implement and maintain a comprehensive information security program, designed to safeguard consumer data and address any weaknesses in TJX's systems in place at the time of the breach. Of the $9.75 million monetary payment under the settlement, $5.5 million is to be dedicated to data protection and consumer protection efforts by the states, and $1.75 million is to reimburse the costs and fees of the investigation. Further, $2.5 million of the settlement will fund a Data Security Trust Fund to be used by the state Attorneys General to advance enforcement efforts and policy development in the field of data security and protecting consumers’ personal information. UPDATE (7/28/2009): Pennsylvania and 40 other states reached a $9.75 million settlement. UPDATE (9/4/2009): TJX settles for $525K with four banks. As part of the settlement with AmeriFirst Bank, Trustco Bank, HarborOne Credit Union and SELCO Community Credit Union, the Framingham, Mass.-based retailer paid $525,000. The money primarily will be used to cover the banks' expenses in pursuing the legal action.UPDATE (12/15/2009):A Miami hacker who had already pleaded guilty to computer fraud and identity theft for breaches at retailers T.J. Maxx, OfficeMax, and many other merchants, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to similar charges related to breaches at Heartland Payment Systems, 7-11, Hannaford Brothers supermarkets, and two other companies. Albert Gonzalez, 28, reiterated terms of a plea agreement in U.S. District Court in Boston. A week earlier, co-conspirator Stephen Watt of New York, appeared in that same court and was ordered to serve two years in prison and pay $171.5 million in restitution for developing a sniffing program used to grab payment card data in the breach at the TJX companies between 2003 and 2008. UPDATE (3/17/2010): Humza Zaman, a co-conspirator in the hack of TJX and other companies, was sentenced in Boston to 46 months in prison and fined $75,000 for his role in the conspiracy. The sentence matches what prosecutors were seeking. Zaman was charged with laundering between $600,000 and $800,000 for hacker Albert Gonzalez, who is currently awaiting sentencing on charges that he and others hacked into TJX, Office Max, Heartland Payment Systems and numerous other companies to steal data on more than 100 million credit and debit card accounts. Zaman pleaded guilty in April to one count of conspiracy. His sentence includes three years of supervised release with the condition that Zaman must disclose his conviction to any future employer. Upon release, Zaman will not be barred from using computers. Zaman is the second conspirator in the TJX case to be charged. Former Morgan Stanley coder, Stephen Watt, was sentenced in December to two years in prison for his role in the TJX case, which involved supplying Gonzalez with a sniffer program used to siphon card data from the TJX network. UPDATE (3/29/2010): A 28-year-old college dropout who became the world’s biggest credit card hacker on Thursday was sentenced to 20 years in prison for stealing millions of credit union and bank account records from TJX Cos., BJ’s Wholesale Club, Office Max, Dave & Busters, Barnes & Noble and a string of other companies – even as he was working as a $75,000-a-year undercover informant for the U.S. government in identity theft cases. But that’s not the end of it, as Albert Gonzalez is scheduled to be sentenced again to additional years behind bars for additional data thefts at Heartland Payment Systems, Hannaford Bros. supermarkets and 7-Eleven convenience stores. The theft of credit card data cost financial institutions, insurers and cardholders an estimated $200 million, according to law enforcement. JC Penney and Wet Seal were both officially added to the list of retail victims of Albert Gonzalez on Friday (March 26) when U.S. District Court Judge Douglas P. Woodlock refused to continue their cloak of secrecy and removed the seal from their names. StorefrontBacktalk had reported last August that $17 billion JC Penney chain was one of Gonzalez.s victims, even though JC Penney's media representatives were denying it. But the $561 million chain Wet Seal, which has 504 stores in 47 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, had kept their identity secret. No more and that.s the way Woodlock wanted it. UPDATE (4/16/2010): Damon Patrick Toey, the 'trusted subordinate' of TJX hacker Albert Gonzalez, was sentenced in Boston to 5 more years in prison. He also received a $100,000 fine and three years. supervised release, according to the Justice Department.UPDATE (7/8/2010): TJX has settled another lawsuit.  The Louisiana Municipal Police Employees' Retirement System, a shareholder of TJX stock, settled with TJX for $595,000 in legal fees and enhanced oversight of customer files.UPDATE (4/8/2011): Albert Gonzalez is appealing his conviction for his role in a
large data breach by claiming that his actions were authorized by the Secret
Service.  The government acknowledged that Gonzalez was a key undercover Secret Service informant at the time of the breaches.  In a 25-page petition, Gonzalez faulted one of his attorney's for failing to prepare a ""Public Authority"" defense, which would have argued that he committed crimes with the approval of government authorities.","Dataloss DB","",2007,42.291762,-71.425895,NA,NA,"",1e+08,2007-01-17,2007-01-29,12,2.484906649788,18.4206807439524,1

Credit and debit card numbers              were stolen during the card authorization transmission process. It's              unclear if personal information was exposed. UPDATE             (4/2/2009): An April 2, 2009, news story indicated that between Dec.              7, 2007, and March 10, 2008, hackers stole credit and debit card numbers,              expiration dates and PIN numbers from people shopping at Hannaford              supermarkets. About 1,800 fraudulent charges had been made. UPDATE             (5/14/2009): A federal appeals court has revived a Tampa class-action              suit seeking money for Florida shoppers whose credit and debit card              numbers were swiped in a data breach that hit 109 Sweetbay Supermarkets.              The suit seeks free credit monitoring, credit repair if necessary              and undetermined money damages to be split up among victims of the              breach, including those unaware they were victims. UPDATE             (5/22/2009): A Maine U.S. District Court dismissed most of a class              action lawsuit against Hannaford, finding that there is no way to              value the time and effort that consumers spent in correcting fraudulent              activity resulting from the breach. The case of one named plaintiff              was not dismissed.

In this case, the criminals used it to log credit and payment card data as it was sent from the branch locations to corporate headquarters. The hacking took place from April to September 2007. At Dave & Buster's Islandia, New York, location, the hackers accessed details of about 5,000 payment cards. The information was sold to other criminals who then used the card numbers to scam online merchants. The criminals were able to post at least $600,000 in fraudulent transactions from 675 cards taken from this one store.UPDATE (04/05/2010): In reaching a settlement with Dave & Buster’s, the FTC quietly and without fanfare introduced a new security standard, requiring the company to monitor and filter outbound Internet traffic to block the unauthorized export of sensitive information.

This incident may be the result of a global cyberfraud operation. UPDATE (01/26/2009): Heartland Payment Systems has been sued. The lawsuit seeks damages and relief for the inexplicable delay, questionable timing, and inaccuracies concerning the disclosures with regard to the data breach, which is believed to be the largest in U.S. history. UPDATE (02/12/2009): According to BankInfoSecurity.com, the number of financial institutions that have come forward to say they have been contacted by their credit card companies Visa and MasterCard in relation to the breach has jumped from fewer than 50 to more than 200. UPDATE (06/04/2009): While it's hard to get a handle on just how many consumers were affected by the Heartland Payment Systems (HPY) data breach, the total number of institutions now reporting card compromises is at 656. UPDATE (06/16/2009): Heartland lawsuits to be heard in Texas. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation in Louisville, KY issued its decision to consolidate the class action suits. The lawsuits will be heard in the Southern District Court of Texas in Houston. Thirty-one separate lawsuits, on behalf of consumers, investors, banks and credit unions, have been filed against Princeton,N.J.-based Heartland. UPDATE (07/06/2009): Heartland Payment Systems successfully completed the first phase of an end-to-end encryption pilot project designed to enhance its security. UPDATE (08/20/2009): Albert Segvec Gonzalez has been indicted by a federal grand jury in New Jersey - along with two unnamed Russian conspirators - on charges of hacking into Heartland Payment Systems, the New Jersey-based card processing company, as well as Hannaford Brothers, 7-Eleven and two unnamed national retailers, according to the indictment unsealed Monday. Gonzalez, a former Secret Service informant, is already awaiting trial over his involvement in the TJX hack.Total records breached: 100 million transactions per month. It is unclear how many account numbers have been compromised, and how many are represented by multiple transactions. The number of records breached is an estimate, subject to revision. UPDATE (08/20/2009): According to the court document, hackers stole more than 130 million credit and debit card numbers from Heartland and Hannaford combined.UPDATE (05/12/2010): The costs to Heartland Payment Systems Inc. from the massive data breach that it disclosed in January 2009 appear to be steadily adding up. Quarterly financial results released by Heartland last week show that the card payment processor has accrued $139.4 million in breach-related expenses. The figure includes a settlement totaling nearly $60 million with Visa, another of about $3.5 million with American Express and more than $26 million in legal fees. That total also includes $42.8 million that Heartland has set aside to fund proposed settlements with several other litigants over the breach. One example of what the fund is set up for is Heartland's offer to settle several consumer class action lawsuits against it for four million. So far, Heartland has recovered about $30 million from insurance companies.UPDATE (06/02/2010): Heartland Payment Systems has made a third settlement deal, this time with MasterCard, related to a massive data breach two years ago at the card payments processor. As part of the deal, Heartland has agreed to pay as much as US$41.1 million to MasterCard issuers that lost money as a result of the data breach. The deal is contingent on financial institutions representing 80 percent of the affected MasterCard accounts accepting the offer by June 25. MasterCard is recommending that issuers accept the offer.UPDATE (09/01/2010): Heartland Payment Systems has agreed to settle with Discover for five million dollars.  Discover will use the money to cover costs of fraud incidents and reissuing cards.UPDATE (09/19/2010): Jerome Abaquin Gonzales is expected to surrender to police and serve jail time for participating in a credit card forgery ring which used information from the Heartland breach.  The information came from the 4.2 million Discover credit card customers who used their cards at Hannaford Brothers.UPDATE (09/22/2010): Thomas Michio Taniguchi was sentenced to prison for his role in the forgery ring in which Jerome Abaquin Gonzales also participated.UPDATE (12/07/2011): Heartland legal representatives were able to successfully argue that most of the claims against Heartland that were filed by nine banks should be dismissed. All but one claim was dismissed.UPDATE (02/12/2012): The nine banks may have had their claims against Heartland dismissed because Heartland reported that sharing a contractual relationship with the banks defeats their appeal. However, the credit-card-issuing banks are arguing that a New Jersey economic loss rule only bars claims for foreseeable economic losses when the parties are in a contractual relationship and does not bar their negligence claim against Heartland.UPDATE (07/25/2013): Five more foreign hackers were charged for their role in stealing information from Heartland Payment Systems, NASDAQ, Dow Jones, JetBlue, and J.C.

Sony placed an outage to block users from playing online games or accessing services like Netflix and Hulu Plus on Friday April 22. Sony says the outage will continue until the situation is addressed, which will likely be within the next week. Sony believes an unauthorized person has obtained names, addresses, email addresses, dates of birth, PlayStation Network/Qriocity password and login, and handle/PSN online IDs for multiple users. The attacker may have also stolen users' purchase history, billing address, and password security questions. User credit card numbers may have also been obtained. Sony has hired a security firm to investigate the incident and strengthen the network infrastructure by re-building their system to provide greater protection of personal information.An individual filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of all PSN users following seven days of a Sony PlayStation Network outage.  The lawsuit alleges that Sony ""failed to encrypt data and establish adequate firewalls to handle a server intrusion contingency, failed to provide prompt and adequate warnings of security breaches, and unreasonably delayed in bringing the PSN service back on line.""  It also accused Sony of violating the Payment Card Industry (PCI) security standard, which prohibits companies from storing cardholder data.UPDATE (5/3/2011): A review of Sony's network breach revealed that it was larger than first thought. Sony turned the SOE system off.  Hackers may have taken personal information from an additional 24,600,000 user accounts in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. Names, addresses, genders, email addresses, login name and associated password, phone numbers and birth dates of SOE gaming customers, as well as data from about 12,700 credit card accounts and 10,700 bank accounts from an outdated 2007 database could have been accessed.  The outdated account information that may have been obtained by hackers includes credit card numbers, debit card numbers, expiration dates, bank account numbers, customer names, account names and customer addresses. The SOE network hosts games that are played over the Internet on personal computers and is separate from the PlayStation network.  Sony has not clearly indicated if credit card numbers were compromised.  At least one report indicates that the numbers were encrypted.  These breached records will not be added to the total until more is known.UPDATE (5/6/2011): Sony now indicates that some credit card numbers were compromised.  Twelve million credit card numbers were unencrypted and could easily be read.UPDATE (5/7/2011): Sony discovered that hackers had placed customer information online. Sony removed the information.  It included customer names and addresses from a 2001 Sony database.Service restoration for the PlayStation network was indefinitely delayed. Additionally, the CEO issued an apology letter.UPDATE (5/17/2011): Hackers began changing user passwords by using PSN account emails and dates of birth within two days of the partial restoration of the PlayStation Network.  Sony failed to alter the password reset system to account for hackers having obtained user email addresses and dates of birth.  Users who changed their passwords, but not the email associated with their PlayStation Network accounts, were vulnerable to the hacker exploit. Sony shut down the PlayStation Network again and released a short statement about the incident.UPDATE (5/23/2011): Sony headquarters expects to spend about $171 million on its personal information theft protection program, welcome back programs, customer support, network security enhancements and legal costs associated with the breach.UPDATE (6/2/2011): Sony fully restored all Playstation Network services in all areas except Japan.  The Playstation Store and Qriocity divisions are now functioning properly.  UPDATE (6/4/2011): A concise history of the Sony hacks can be found here.UPDATE (7/21/2011): Zurich American, one of Sony's insurers, is suing to deny releasing data breach coverage funds to Sony.  Sony expects the breach to lower operating profit by $178 million in the current financial year.  A total of 55 class action complaints have been filed.UPDATE (10/11/2011): Sony Online Entertainment became aware of a large number of unauthorized sign-in attempts.  The attempts took place between October 7 and 10.  About 93,000 PlayStation Network, Sony Entertainment Network, and Sony Online Entertainment services accounts may have been compromised.  The unauthorized parties appear to have verified valid sign-in IDs and passwords after a number of failed attempts.  Sony temporarily locked those accounts. It is unclear if the email addresses were obtained from a previous breach.UPDATE (10/19/2012): A federal judge found that Sony users signed a privacy policy informing them that Sony's security was not perfect.  Sony was cleared of negligence, unjust enrichment, bailment, and violations of California consumer protection statutes. The judge ruled that plaintiffs could not claim that Sony violated consumer-protection laws because PSN services were free of cost.  This dismissed much of the lawsuit.UPDATE (12/16/2013): Sony agreed to drop an insurance claim over litigation related to the 2011 breach.UPDATE (7/30/2014): ""Sony recently offered to settle a class action lawsuit over the 2011 breach of its PlayStation Network. According to the terms of the proposed $15 million settlement, the money will be paid out in the form of games. Class members who didn't take advantage of initial ""Welcome Back"" package of games and memberships offered in 2011 will receive on of the 14 PlayStation 3 or PlayStation Portable games, as well as three of six PS3 themes or a three-month PlayStation Plus subscription.

Customers who used a payment card at any of Target's stores nationwide between November 27, 2013 and December 15, 2013 may have had their payment card information copied for fraudulent purposes.  Credit card companies and banks have been notifying customers of the issue and advising them to watch for suspicious charges.  Customer names, credit or debit card numbers, card expiration dates, and card security codes were taken and have appeared on the black market.UPDATE (12/24/2013): Target now faces at least three class-action lawsuits as a result of the breach.  A wave of scam artists are attempting to profit from the breach by posing as Target or bank representatives addressing the breach.  People who shopped at Target are being warned not to give their information out over the phone.  Target is working with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Secret Service to investigate the breach.UPDATE (12/27/2013): Target customers are also being warned to be suspicious of emails claiming to be from Target or banks that request personal information.  It is estimated that the breach may cost Target up to $3.6 billion.  It appears that online customers were not affected.UPDATE (12/28/2013): Target confirmed that PINs associated with payment cards were also exposed.UPDATE (1/2/2014): East-West bank has issued a letter to their card holders warning that some of their accounts may have been compromised due to the Target data breach. East-West bank has issued new credit cards to their customers who shopped at any Target stores to reduce any potential unauthorized use of a card. (Source CA Attorney Generals' Office)UPDATE (1/10/2014): Target Corp. says that up to 70 million people were affected by the data breach, significantly more than was originally suspected. Experts predict the numbers could climb even higher than 70 million once the company completes its investigation. UPDATE (1/13/2014): Target Corp. has confirmed that malware was found on the Point of Sale devices. The malware has been removed. The number of individuals affected are now said to be 110 million individuals, 70 million more than originally thought.UPDATE (1/13/2014): Security experts are stating that Target may not be alone in the data breach. Neiman Marcus and at least 3 other unnamed retailers (these retailers are thought to be located in Eastern Europe) may also have been compromised as federal investigators track what they believe to be an international crime ring. UPDATE (1/14/2014): Companies that help Target process payments could be facing millions of dollars in fines and costs as a result of the data breach.UPDATE (1/16/2014): The malware that infected in the Target POS systems has been found and is known as the Trojan.POSRAM, according to new report by investigators. ""The malware is a memory-scraping tool that grabs card data directly from point-of-sale terminals and then stores it on the victims system for later retrieval"". The malware was originally thought to have been developed in Russia, known as BlackPOS. This new version is considered to be highly customized so that current anitvirus programs would not have detected it as reported by investigative agencies.UPDATE (1/20/2014): ""A 17 year-old Russian national from St. Petersburg is thought to be responsible for the malicious programming that allowed for data from Target and Neiman Marcus to be compromised,"" according to a California based security firm.UPDATE (1/21/2014): Two Mexican citizens were arrested at the border in South Texas for the purchase of thousands of dollars worth of merchandise with information stolen during the Target security breach, as reported by a South Texas police chief.A spokesman with the Secret Service announced that the investigation is ongoing into the possibility of a link between the Target breach and the two arrested in Texas. UPDATE (1/29/2014): The malware used in the Target attack could suggest a poorly secured feature built into a popular IT management software product that was running on the retailers internal newtork.UPDATE (1/29/2014):  A Target Corp. investor filed suit in Minnesota federal court Wednesday, against the retailers Executives holding them liable for damage caused by the holiday season data breach that saw hackers steal personal and financial information from tens of millions of customers.Shareholder Maureen Collier filed the suite with a complaint alleging that Target's board and top executives harmed the company financially by failing to take adequate steps to prevent the cyberattack then by subsequently providing customers with incomplete and misleading information about the extent of the data theft.""The suit brings claims of breach of fiduciary duty, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets and abuse of control, and seeks monetary damages on behalf of the company from the 14 named officers and directors"".UPDATE (2/5/2014): Hackers who broke into Target's computer network and stole customers'
 financial and personal data used credentials alledgedly  were stolen from a 
heating and air conditioning subcontractor in Pennsylvania, according to
 digital security journalist Brian Krebs.It appears as though the air conditioning company was given access to Target's 
computer network in order for the vendor to make remote changes to the system to  cut heating and cooling costs. Target has not confirmed the accuracy of this report.UPDATE (2/6/2014): Target Corporation announced they are fast tracking new credit card security technology in their stores, 6 months earlier than originally planned. Target's CFO announced it is moving up its goal to utilize chip-enabled smart cards, 
and now plans to have them in stores by early 2015. These cards encrypt point of sale data,
 rendering the credit card number less useful if stolen. Currently this technology is more prevalent outide of the US, but have resulted in

United Kingdom.UPDATE (2/15/2014): The breach at the Target Copr. that exposed credit card and personal data on more than 110 million consumers appears to have begun with a malware-laced email phishing attack sent to employees at the HVAC contractor Fazio Mechanical in Sharpsburg Pennsylvania. According to Krebs on Security, ""multiple sources close to the investigation now tell this reporter that those credentials were stolen in an email malware attack at Fazio that began at least two months before thieves started stealing card data from thousands of Target cash registers.""UPDATE (5/5/2014): Target's CEO has resigned in the wake of the data breach over the holiday season. He is claiming the breach was his fault. He is the second major executive to resign. Earlier in the year the company's Chief Technology Office resigned as well. The CFO of the company will take over as the interim CEO.UPDATE (8/7/2014): Target has announced that the data breach will cost it's shareholders $148 million. UPDATE (12/9/2014): A Minnesota ruled that a lawsuit put forth by several banks could proceed as the court stated that Target failed to adequately defend against the massive data breach they suffered. This is the first time a data breach case of this size has moved forward based on a companies failure to respond to warnings from security software/experts.

of future fraudulent charges and greater susceptibility to identity 
theft. Chief Judge Wood noted that “the Neiman Marcus customers should 
not have to wait until hackers commit identity theft or credit-card 
fraud in order to give the class standing, because there is an

Wednesday's filing in a proposed class-action lawsuit does not detail
 settlement terms or how many current and former Sony employees would be
 covered by the settlement. 
Plaintiffs' attorney Daniel Girard wrote that he and fellow lawyers 
believe the settlement is favorable to employees whose personal, 
financial and medical information was posted online. 
Additional details about the settlement are expected to be filed in a Los Angeles federal court by mid-October.""More Information: http://www.usnews.com/news/entertainment/articles/2015/09/02/federal-son...","Media","",2014,40.712784,-74.005941,NA,NA,"",47000,2014-11-24,2014-12-01,7,1.94591014905531,10.7579028806922,1

When the campus detected a vulnerability in one of these areas in November, the campus began installing and testing a security fix — known as a patch — which can take weeks, Rivers said during the press call. During this process, attackers were able to discover a security flaw and gained access to the system.BFS contains the information of about 50 percent of current students and 65 percent of active employees. Affected individuals largely include students, faculty and staff who received payments from the campus, mainly through electronic fund transfers. Those who received paper payments, however, may have also been affected.A private computer investigation firm was retained by the campus to further determine whether personal information was compromised. The campus will send notice letters in the mail with more information about free credit monitoring and insurance to those who were potentially impacted starting Friday.According to Rivers, this is the third significant breach UC Berkeley has seen in the past five years.Within a day of the unauthorized intrusion Dec. 28, the campus’s security team had detected and began efforts to contain the attack, according to campus spokesperson Janet Gilmore.Once campus IT staff identified the unauthorized access, they forensically preserved copies of the system for investigation purposes and took affected servers offline for about two weeks to prevent further access. When the campus shut down BFS and supporting systems, some students received emails in early January notifying them of possible disruptions to financial aid disbursements.""More information: http://www.dailycal.org/2016/02/26/campus-notifies-nearly-80000-students...","Media","",2015,37.871593,-122.272747,NA,NA,"",80000,2016-02-26,2016-02-26,0.256367604015395,-1.36114291131231,11.289781913656,0

The credentials are from early 2013, prior to Tumblr's acquisition by Yahoo, officials said in a May 12 blog post.  
The site's security team investigated the matter as soon as it became aware of the incident.
“Our analysis gives us no reason to believe that this information was used to access Tumblr accounts,” the blog said. 
Officials said in the blog that those affected will be required to 
set a new password as a precaution. Users are instructed to visit the 
sites security page for more information on how to keep their accounts 
secure.""More information: https://www.scmagazine.com/tumblr-announces-email-credentials-compromise...UPDATE (5/31/2016):  ""More than 65 million Tumblr accounts from a 2013 breach were spotted for sale on the dark web. 
Security researcher and Haveibeenpwned
 owner Troy Hunt recently found a database containing the stolen account
 information for sale on a dark web market site and listed the breach on
 his own site as the third largest ever.
A hacker known as Peace was selling the database for $150, according to Vice's Motherboard.
 Peace told Motherboard the price is so low because the salted passwords
 are very difficult to crack however, Hunt told the publication roughly 
half of the passwords will likely be cracked due to weak password 
protections that were used at the time. 
On May 12, Tumblr notified
 users of the breach that compromised user email addresses with salted 
and hashed passwords from early 2013 and told users there is no reason 
to believe that the information was used to access their Tumblr 
accounts.
Although the breach isn't as bad as other major breaches, it has the 
potential to be dangerous for users who re-use passwords, Kaspersky Lab 
Senior Security Researcher Brian Bartholomew told SCMagazine.com via 
email. 
“If you were to think about how many users from Tumblr have Apple 
cloud accounts, Twitter accounts, Gmail or other online mail accounts, 
etc. the potential risk is high for this breach to bleed over into other
 stories down the road,” he said.  “These credentials could be used by 
criminals to access anything from bank accounts, to mail accounts, to 
other online systems that may house personal data / pictures / etc.”
Bartholomew also said the credentials could be used to carry out phishing attacks, targeting and extortion.""More information: https://www.scmagazine.com/tumblr-accounts-from-2013-breach-for-sale-on-...","Media","",2016,40.712784,-74.005941,NA,NA,"",65469300,2016-05-13,2016-05-17,4,1.38629436111989,17.9970918884402,0
"5/17/2016","LinkedIn","Mountain View","California","HACK","BSO","117,000,000","""A recent incident involving LinkedIn, the business-oriented social 
networking service, is showing that data breaches can cause big problems
 for companies and consumers — even years after the breaches take place.
 On May 17, 2016, LinkedIn discovered that information stolen in a 2012 
incident was being made available online, and notified site users immediately the next day about what happened and what they were doing to fix it.
In 2012, an alleged 117 million
 email and password combinations were stolen by hackers. At the time, 
LinkedIn issued a mandatory password reset for any accounts they thought
 were compromised; all LinkedIn members were encouraged to change their 
passwords as well, just in case.
Fast forward to present day, and the 2012 breach has come back to 
haunt LinkedIn. The stolen data popped up online, and in an e-mail to 
LinkedIn users sent on May 25, 2016, the company said the published 
information included email addresses, hashed passwords, and LinkedIn 
member IDs, which are an internal identifier LinkedIn assigns to each 
member profile. They immediately invalidated passwords of all LinkedIn 
accounts that were created prior to the 2012 breach and had not 
undergone a password reset since the breach.
LinkedIn’s attempts to protect users, however, are extending beyond 
resetting passwords this time. They are also using automated tools to 
try and identify (and block) any suspicious activity on specific 
LinkedIn accounts. The proper authorities have been contacted and 
LinkedIn is working with law enforcement. They have demanded that anyone
 making stolen password data available must stop immediately, or face 
potential legal action.
In their e-mail, the company also shared that they have improved 
security features since the 2012 breach, which will hopefully prevent 
another incident like this from happening in the future. As examples, 
they noted that they use salted hashes to store passwords and offer two-step verification
 for members who are interested in additional security. LinkedIn also

On December 23, 2015, CoPilot received complaints claiming that personal information submitted to the site, including health information, was accessible for downloading from the website. CoPilot immediately launched an investigation and retained a leading cybersecurity consulting firm to assist in its investigation of what occurred.

No one has heard back from the manufacturers as the data hit the web and was passed around between hackers and researchers.The magnitude of problems and the nature of the victims — small children and families — have set up the CloudPets hack to be a textbook-example security failure for a long time to come. Spiral Toys is a virtually worthless company, according to its stock prices and activity. It does not appear to have a functioning phone number, and no one at Spiral Toys has answered an email on this issue for months, including messages sent Monday by CyberScoop.CloudPets’ data is stored in a public-facing MongoDB database without any authentication required. The database was indexed by search engines like Shodan and found independently by multiple individuals. There was no password to protect the database. Users have no password requirements on their own accounts and the site itself offers no security.In mid-January, as hackers attacked and ransomed thousands of critically vulnerable MongoDB databases, researchers saw the CloudPets database suffer the same fate. Unlike other databases, whose owners paid the ransom or at least responded to the demands, Spiral Toys appears to have been silent on the issue as the database was deleted and ransomed numerous times over the next several days.Sensitive data was exposed, Hunt wrote, and no parents were ever notified.""More information: https://www.cyberscoop.com/internet-connected-teddy-bear-company-hacked-...","Media","",2017,34.052234,-118.243685,NA,NA,"",2e+06,2017-02-27,2017-02-28,1,0,14.5086577385242,0

Access to ePHI was gained via a third-party vendor system used by Brand New Day’s contracting provider six days previously on December 22, 2016.The breach notification submitted to the California attorney general does not indicate whether the ePHI of plan members was stolen, although the data were accessed and a criminal investigation into the breach has been launched by law enforcement. The types of data accessed include plan members’ names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth and Medicare ID numbers.Upon discovery of the incident, Brand New Day immediately launched an investigation and contacted its vendor to ensure that access to ePHI was immediately terminated. The vendor was informed that someone had improperly accessed plan members’ data and rapid action was taken to block access. Brand New Day says the error that allowed ePHI to be accessed was eliminated ‘within hours’ of its vendor being notified of the breach.While no specific mention of the exact nature of improper access was made, Brand New Day says “We changed our practices regarding access requiring monthly verification of each user.” Brand New Day is also performing a thorough ‘self audit’ to determine whether any other errors have occurred that jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity and availability of ePHI.As a precaution against identity theft, all affected individuals have been offered 12 months’ complimentary identity theft mitigation services via Experian.The breach report submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights indicates 14,005 individuals were impacted by the incident.

In 2015, 17 million students used FAFSA to file for financial aid.Fraudulent tax returns have become a growing issue for the IRS, as hackers find more sophisticated measures to steal financial documents online.

The researcher was unable to provide the Dot with evidence of the breach because he delete the database from his own computer shortly after realizing the leaked data pertained to minors.“The sheer volume of private student data, including [test] scores and social security numbers for children, convinced me that it should be purged from my storage in an expedited fashion,” Vickery said.The Daily Dot was unable to immediately confirm which U.S. schools may have been affected. However, Vickery confirmed (and praised) the swift action of Schoolzilla, which he said corrected the issue and secured the students’ information within 24 hours. “As soon as we learned of it, we immediately fixed the error and confirmed no one accessed any information, other than the researcher,” the company said.Unfortunately, that’s an atypical response. It is a common issue that many companies respond with suspicion when reached by outside security researchers reporting vulnerabilities that expose their customers’ data. In contrast, Schoolzilla responded to his notification appropriately, Vickery said, and took immediate action to secure its data.  “This was the first situation of its kind for them and they reacted professionally,” Vickery said. “It must have been grueling for the CEO to phone each client and relay the unpleasant news, but they did it within only a few days of my report.”","Media","https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/1-3-million-american-students-exposed-data-breach-now-secured/",2017,37.810299,-122.265998,NA,NA,"",1300000,2017-04-12,2017-04-18,6,1.79175946922805,14.0778748224318,0

It has since been eliminated.
